# NextPrime-Muitiplication-
  This task is to implement the following function: `FindNextPrime`.
 As the name states, given the number `n` the function should return 
 the next closest prime. 


 Examples:
  * `FindNextPrime(1000000000)` should return  1000000007
  * `FindNextPrime(10000000000)` should return 10000000019

 Afterward, the next closed two prime numbers will provide as input through scanf 
 to multiply with each and other. Finally, the last 14-dight of the product will be printed. 
 
 Anyone can use whatever you want (data structures, language features, etc).
 
 Unit tests would be a plus.
